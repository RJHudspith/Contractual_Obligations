\section{Introduction}

Welcome to the Corr library for fermionic contractions. 
The code requires propagator solutions in the form of saved
propagator files which it then contracts into various
correlation functions. As of writing the code supports

\begin{itemize}
\item Flavour diagonal and off-diagonal meson contractions.
\item Flavour diagonal and off-diagonal baryon contractions.
\item Flavour diagonal and off-diagonal conserved Wilson currents.
\item Tetraquark operators in development
\item Weak matrix element computation for Wall source propagators.
\item Momentum projection for correlators.
\end{itemize}
